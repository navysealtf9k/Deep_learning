# Deep_learning

This repository contains my experimentation with the predictive capabilities of different neural network architectures. These are projects I built as part of the ** Deep learning A-Z ** course I took on Udemy.

### REPO Contents
The table below provides a brief description of the different projects in this repository as follows: 


Folder Name | Description | Link
:------------ | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------:
Aritifical_Neural_Networks | This folder contains code I wrote to solve a customer churn problem. I use an ANN to predict which customers of a bank would close their account and which would keep them open. The tuned ANN I built achieves a prediction accuracy of 86% on an unseen test set| [Click here](https://github.com/navysealtf9k/Deep_learning/tree/master/Artificial_Neural_Networks)
Recurrent_Neural_Networks| TBD.| [Click here](https://github.com/navysealtf9k/Deep_learning)
